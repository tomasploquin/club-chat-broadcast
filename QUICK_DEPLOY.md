# ⚡ Quick Deploy - Get Your App Live in 5 Minutes

## 🚀 Fastest Option: Railway

1. **Push to GitHub** (if not already):
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Railway**:
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Sign up with GitHub
   - Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Select your `club-chat-broadcast` repository
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for automatic build and deployment

4. **Your app is live!** 🎉
   - You'll get a URL like: `https://club-chat-broadcast-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`

## 📱 Share with Your Customer

Your customer can now access the app at the Railway URL!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **WhatsApp Bridge**: You'll need to run your Go WhatsApp bridge separately or configure it for the deployed environment
- **QR Code**: Your customer will need to scan the WhatsApp QR code to connect their WhatsApp account
- **Free Tier**: Railway gives you 500 hours free per month (enough for testing)

## 🎯 If You Need a Custom Domain

1. **Buy a domain** (e.g., from Namecheap, GoDaddy)
2. **In Railway**: Go to Settings → Custom Domain
3. **Add your domain** and follow DNS instructions
